# Ego Trajectory Visualization (Exploratory)

This notebook explores ego vehicle trajectories extracted from the
Waymo Open Motion Dataset.

The goal of this notebook is to:
- extract short-horizon ego trajectories
- recenter trajectories at their starting point
- rotate trajectories so the initial heading aligns with the x-axis
- visualize resulting trajectory geometry

This is an exploratory notebook intended for qualitative understanding
rather than model training or performance benchmarking.
